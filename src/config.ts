  aboutMe:
    "AI/ML engineer and ex-SDE Intern at AWS. I build agentic AI systems end to endâ€”data pipelines, model training and evaluation, and production deployment on AWS. Iâ€™ve shipped computer vision and LLM/RAG projects in healthcare and autonomy, and I care about scalability, observability, and cost. I like turning messy logs and research papers into simple, useful products. Currently exploring robust AI agents, evaluation harnesses, and scalable MLOps on AWS. Iâ€™m also seeking a full-time role where I can build and ship reliable AI.",

Combines LLMs with vector search (LangChain + Pinecone) to deliver grounded, context-aware answers instead of relying purely on model memory. Demonstrates end-to-end AI: data ingestion, embeddings, retrieval, UI (Flask), and AWS CI/CD deployment.",
