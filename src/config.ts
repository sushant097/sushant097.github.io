  aboutMe:
    "AI/ML engineer and ex-AWS SDE intern who ships agentic AI systems from data pipelines to training/eval to production on AWS. Iâ€™ve delivered CV and LLM/RAG features in healthcare and autonomy, and I obsess over scalability, observability, and cost. I turn messy logs and research into simple, useful productsâ€”and I'm actively open to full-time roles.",
